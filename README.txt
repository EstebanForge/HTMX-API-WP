An un-official WordPress plugin that adds HTMX to your WordPress site. Intended for software developers.

== Description ==
An un-official WordPress plugin that adds HTMX to your WordPress site. It enables a new endpoint /wp-htmx/v1/ from where you can load any HTMX template.

HTMX is a javascript library that allows you to access AJAX, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, without writing any javascript.
It re-uses an "old" concept, [Hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/), to deal the modern web in a more HTML like and natural way.
